- Some drives report temperatures in 10th of a degree Celsius.
  In that case, the second byte of raw data is relevant. 
  This is known to affect SAMSUNG SV0412H and SAMSUNG SV1204H.
  Those are 40GB and 120GB Ultra-ATA drives; maybe it is irrelevant
  enough not to care.
- On some drives, the content of attribute a90 and/or 194 appears
  to be unknown to be unreliable or unknown. This affects drives
  from Apple (190) Maxtor (194). See libatasmart for details.
  The Apple drive is a SSD; the bug against it was opened in 2009.
  Maxtor drives are old Ultra-ATA drives. Maybe those are irrelevant
  as well.
