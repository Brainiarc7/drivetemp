Driver for SMART temperature sensors on (S)ATA drives
-----------------------------------------------------

S.M.A.R.T. temperature sensors have been supported for years by userspace
tools such as smarttools and hddtemp. This driver adds support to read
the temperature directly from the kernel using the hwmon API and adds a
temperature zone for each drive.

With this driver, the hard disk temperature can be read using the
unprivileged 'sensors' application:
    
$ sensors smarttemp-scsi-1-0
smarttemp-scsi-1-0
Adapter: SCSI adapter
temp1:        +23.0Â°C
    
or directly from sysfs:
    
$ grep . /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon9/{name,temp1_input}
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon9/name:smarttemp
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon9/temp1_input:23000

Note: 'sensors' has to be from the most recent version of the lm-sensors
package.
